# Multilingual Text Classification with Siamese Neural Network

## Overview
This project implements a Siamese neural network using the XLM-RoBERTa transformer to handle multilingual text data, significantly improving cross-lingual text classification tasks.

## Features
- **Multilingual Text Handling**: Utilizes XLM-RoBERTa transformer for processing and tokenizing large-scale multilingual datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Handles sequences up to 512 tokens, ensuring robust input representation.
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapts pre-trained language models for toxic comment classification across diverse linguistic contexts.
- **High Performance**: Achieved an accuracy of 92.5%, precision of 91.3%, recall of 90.8%, and an F1-score of 91.0% on the test dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the correct format.
2. Tokenize the dataset using the XLM-RoBERTa tokenizer.
3. Train the Siamese neural network:
    ```python
    python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/dataset
    ```
4. Evaluate the model:
    ```python
    python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/your/model
    ```

## Results
The model demonstrated the following performance on the test dataset:
- **Accuracy**: 92.5%
- **Precision**: 91.3%
- **Recall**: 90.8%
- **F1-score**: 91.0%
